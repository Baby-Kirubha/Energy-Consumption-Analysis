# Energy-Consumption-Analysis
### Objective:
To analyse energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS
### Technologies Used
* Python
*  EDA
*  PowerBI
### STEPS DONE IN THE PROJECT
* Understanding problem statement
* Data Extraction:
    Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for the Broader Public Sector - Dataset - Ontario Data Catalogue this link is used to collect the necessary data to achieve our objective
    Data has been collected for the years 2012 to 2021
* Data cleaning:
    Since itâ€™s a real world data its not in proper format ,in order to clean this data set 
        Python and
        MS-excel was used
    Once data for various year is cleaned it is concatenated as a single file
* Exploratory Data Analysis:
        This is done to understand the data
        For feature relationship 
        Feature selection 
        Getting business insights etc..
* Visualisation:
      Done using PowerBI
